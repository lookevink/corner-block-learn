### What is an LLC?
A **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** is a business structure that provides its owners (referred to as members) with limited liability protection, meaning that their personal assets are generally protected from the company’s debts and liabilities. An LLC can be owned by a single individual or multiple members, and it combines the flexibility of a partnership with the liability protections of a corporation.

>**TL;DR:** An LLC is a business structure offering limited liability protection to its owners, shielding personal assets from company debts and obligations.

### Key Characteristics of an LLC

1. **Limited Liability Protection**: Members of an LLC are typically not personally responsible for the company’s debts or legal obligations. Their risk is limited to the amount of money they have invested in the LLC.

2. **Flexibility in Management**: LLCs can be managed by their members (member-managed) or by appointed managers (manager-managed), providing flexibility in how the business is operated.

3. **Pass-Through Taxation**: LLCs often benefit from pass-through taxation, meaning the company's profits and losses are reported on the individual members' tax returns, avoiding the double taxation common with corporations.

4. **Fewer Formalities**: Compared to corporations, LLCs have fewer regulatory requirements, such as no need for board meetings or extensive record-keeping, making them easier to manage.

5. **Versatile Ownership Structure**: An LLC can have an unlimited number of members, including individuals, corporations, and other LLCs, offering versatility in ownership and investment.
