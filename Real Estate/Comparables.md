**Comparables** ("comps"), in the context of real estate, are properties that are similar in key characteristics to a specific property being evaluated or appraised. These properties are used as benchmarks to determine the market value of the subject property, based on recent sales, listings, or rental rates of similar assets in the same or similar location.

>**TL;DR:** Comparables are similar properties used to estimate the market value of a property by comparing recent sales, listings, or rental rates.

### Key Characteristics of Comparables

1. **Similarity**: Comparables must closely match the property in question in terms of size, location, age, condition, and property type (e.g., single-family home, condo, etc.). The more similar the comp, the more accurate the valuation.

2. **Recent Transactions**: The most relevant comparables are properties that have been sold or rented recently, as they reflect the current market conditions and trends.

3. **Location Proximity**: Ideally, comparables are located within the same neighborhood or area as the subject property. Market dynamics can vary significantly between regions, making proximity crucial for accurate valuation.

4. **Market-Based Adjustments**: When exact comparables aren't available, adjustments are made to account for differences between the subject property and the comparables, such as adding or subtracting value for differences in square footage, amenities, or condition.

5. **Use in Appraisal and Valuation**: Comparables are essential in real estate appraisals and are used by appraisers, real estate agents, and investors to determine a fair market price for buying, selling, or renting properties.
