**Fair Market Value (FMV)** is the estimated price at which an asset would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell, and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts about the asset. It represents the most accurate measure of an asset's value under normal market conditions.

>**TL;DR:** Fair Market Value is the price an asset would sell for in an open and competitive market under normal conditions.

### Key Characteristics of Fair Market Value

1. **Willing Buyer and Seller**: FMV assumes that both the buyer and the seller are acting in their own best interests, without any pressure or duress to complete the transaction.

2. **Market Conditions**: FMV is determined under normal market conditions, where the asset is exposed to the open market for a sufficient period, and the price reflects current demand and supply.

3. **Informed Parties**: FMV assumes that both parties involved in the transaction have adequate knowledge of the asset and its market, including any factors that might influence its value.

4. **Objective Valuation**: FMV is often used in legal, tax, and financial contexts to ensure an objective and unbiased valuation of an asset, such as real estate, stocks, or other investments.

5. **Comparable Sales**: In real estate, FMV is often determined by comparing the prices of similar properties (comparables) that have recently sold in the same area under similar conditions.
