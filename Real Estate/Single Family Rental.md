A Single Family Rental (SFR) refers to a residential property designed to house a single family or household, rented out to tenants by the property owner. SFRs include standalone homes, townhouses, or duplexes, each typically offering private living spaces, yards, and personal amenities that appeal to families. Investing in SFRs is a popular real estate strategy due to the relative stability of rental income, the potential for property value appreciation, and the less complex property management compared to multi-family units or commercial properties.

>TL;DR: Single Family Rentals are individual residential properties rented out to tenants, providing stable income streams for investors with relatively low property management complexity.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Property Type:** SFRs are typically standalone homes or townhouses that cater to one family or household, offering private living spaces, yards, and amenities.
- **Investment Appeal:** SFRs are attractive to investors for their stable rental income, the potential for long-term property appreciation, and less intensive property management compared to multi-family units or commercial properties.
- **Tenant Demand:** Demand for SFRs is often strong, particularly in suburban or family-oriented communities, driven by the desire for more space, privacy, and proximity to good schools and neighborhoods.
- **Ownership & Financing:** SFRs are generally easier to finance with traditional mortgages, and investors can often leverage low-interest rates to maximize returns.
- **Property Management:** Managing an SFR typically involves less complexity compared to multi-family properties, as there is only one tenant or household to manage per property, reducing operational burdens.
