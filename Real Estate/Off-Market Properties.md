**Off-market properties** are real estate assets that are not listed on public [[Multiple Listing Services]] (MLS) or other traditional real estate listing platforms. These properties are typically sold privately, often through direct negotiations between the buyer and seller or through specialized networks of real estate professionals.

>**TL;DR:** Off-market properties are real estate assets sold privately without being listed on public platforms, often involving direct negotiation between buyer and seller.

### Key Characteristics of Off-Market Properties

1. **Private Sale**: Off-market properties are sold without being advertised on public platforms, making them accessible primarily through private networks, word-of-mouth, or direct outreach to property owners.

2. **Negotiation Flexibility**: Because the sale is private, there is often greater flexibility in terms of price, terms, and conditions, allowing for potentially better deals for both buyers and sellers.

3. **Less Competition**: Buyers of off-market properties often face less competition compared to publicly listed properties, as fewer people are aware of the opportunity.

4. **Discretion for Sellers**: Sellers may choose to keep their property off-market to maintain privacy, avoid the hassle of open houses, or to test the market without formally listing the property.

5. **Potential for Better Deals**: Since these properties aren't exposed to the broader market, there can be opportunities to acquire them at below-market prices, particularly if the seller is motivated.
