An **Automated Valuation Model (AVM)** is a system that uses mathematical modeling and data analysis to estimate the [[Fair Market Value|fair market value]] of real estate properties. AVMs pull in a variety of data points, such as property characteristics, recent sales, market trends, and historical data, to generate a valuation. These models are designed to provide fast, unbiased, and consistent property valuations without the need for a physical inspection or manual appraisal.

>**TL;DR:** An Automated Valuation Model (AVM) estimates property values using data like property characteristics, recent sales, and market trends. It enables fast, objective, and consistent property valuations, helping CornerBlock efficiently screen and assess potential investments for its platform.

### Key Components of an AVM

1. **Data Collection**: AVMs rely on vast amounts of data, including public property records, tax assessments, sales histories, and market trends. This data is collected from various sources such as government databases, real estate listings, and private data providers.

2. **Property Characteristics**: The model considers specific characteristics of the property, such as size, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, and condition. These attributes help the AVM refine its valuation by comparing similar properties.

3. **Comparable Sales (Comps)**: AVMs use recent sales data of similar properties in the same area (known as comparables or "comps") to help determine the estimated value. The more similar the comps, the more accurate the AVM's estimation is likely to be.

4. **Mathematical Modeling**: The AVM uses statistical and machine learning models to analyze the collected data. These models look for patterns and relationships in the data to predict the property's value. The algorithms adjust for factors like location, market conditions, and specific property features.

5. **Market Trends and Adjustments**: AVMs factor in broader market trends, such as supply and demand dynamics, interest rates, and economic conditions. They may also include adjustments for seasonal variations or changes in the local economy.

6. **Accuracy and Confidence Scores**: An AVM typically provides not just a valuation but also an accuracy or confidence score. This score reflects how reliable the valuation is based on the quality and quantity of data available.

### Relevance of AVM to CornerBlock

In CornerBlock's model, the Automated Valuation Model plays a crucial role in evaluating potential properties for investment. Here's how AVMs are relevant to the platform:

1. **Property Screening**: AVMs help CornerBlock quickly and efficiently screen large numbers of properties to determine which ones meet the required yield and investment criteria. Properties that pass the AVM analysis are then considered for listing on the platform.

2. **Objective Valuation**: By using AVMs, CornerBlock ensures that property valuations are objective, data-driven, and consistent, reducing the risk of human error or bias in the investment process.

3. **Transparency for Investors**: The AVM provides investors with a clear, data-backed estimate of a property's value, helping them make informed decisions when considering bids on tokenized properties.

4. **Cost and Time Efficiency**: AVMs allow for faster property assessments without the need for costly and time-consuming manual appraisals, enabling CornerBlock to move quickly on attractive investment opportunities.
