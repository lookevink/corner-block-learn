1. **Diversification**:
    - **Automated Portfolio Balancing**: Smart contracts enable automatic diversification across multiple properties, based on individual risk preferences and investment goals.
    - **Periodic Reviews**: The portfolio's performance is periodically reviewed, and investors can vote to rebalance or sell properties as needed.
2. **Exit Strategies**:
    - **Property Sale**: Investors may vote to sell the property if market conditions are favorable. The proceeds are distributed proportionally to token holders, or reinvested into new opportunities.
    - **Token Liquidation**: Investors can exit their position by selling tokens on the secondary market at any time, offering an ongoing exit strategy without the need for a property sale.
