**DAO LLCs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization Limited Liability Companies)** are a hybrid structure that integrates the decentralized governance mechanisms of a DAO with the legal protections and formalities of a [[LLC|traditional LLC]]. This structure is particularly relevant in the context of blockchain-based platforms like CornerBlock, as it enables the decentralized community (i.e., token holders) to collectively manage assets and make decisions while benefiting from the legal protections and operational frameworks provided by an LLC.

**TL;DR:** DAO LLCs combine decentralized governance of a DAO with the legal protections of an LLC, allowing token holders to collectively manage assets and decisions while enjoying legal and operational safeguards.

### Key Features of DAO LLCs

1. **Decentralized Governance**: In a DAO LLC, decision-making is done through on-chain voting, where token holders vote on proposals related to the organizationâ€™s operations, such as asset management and budgeting. This ensures that control is distributed among members rather than centralized.

2. **Smart Contracts**: DAO LLCs utilize smart contracts to automate various processes, such as executing transactions and distributing profits. These contracts operate autonomously on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and reducing the need for intermediaries.

3. **Legal Structure**: Unlike a traditional DAO, a DAO LLC is a legally recognized entity that can enter into contracts, own property, and engage in legal actions. Incorporating as an LLC protects members from personal liability, limiting legal and financial liabilities to the DAO LLC's assets.

4. **Flexible Participation**: Members of a DAO LLC can choose their level of involvement, ranging from active participation in governance to a more passive role of holding tokens and voting on major issues.

### Relevance of DAO LLCs to CornerBlock

1. **Collective Property Management**: In CornerBlock's model, the DAO LLC holds the title to SFR properties acquired through the platform. Fractional owners (token holders) collectively own the property through the DAO LLC and vote on important decisions such as property management, renovations, or sales.

2. **Legal and Operational Protection**: The DAO LLC structure provides investors with legal protection, limiting any legal issues or liabilities to the DAO LLC and safeguarding individual investors' personal assets.

3. **Streamlined Decision-Making**: Smart contracts within the DAO LLC enable automated and efficient decision-making. For example, smart contracts can execute property transactions automatically once a majority vote is reached, ensuring fast and tamper-proof processes.

4. **Enhanced Investor Participation**: Investors in CornerBlock actively participate in managing their investments through the DAO LLC, voting on key decisions like selecting property managers or approving major expenses, giving them more control and involvement.

5. **Scalability and Flexibility**: The DAO LLC model allows CornerBlock to scale by adding new properties and investors. Each property can be held by a separate DAO LLC, containing risks and liabilities independently, while allowing investors to diversify by holding tokens in different DAO LLCs.
