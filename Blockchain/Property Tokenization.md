**Property tokenization** is the process of converting ownership rights in a real estate asset, such as a single-family rental ([[Single Family Rental|SFR]]) property, into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent fractional ownership of the property, allowing multiple investors to own a portion of the asset without the need to purchase the entire property.

>**TL;DR:** Property tokenization transforms real estate ownership into digital tokens on a blockchain, enabling fractional ownership and increased liquidity in the real estate market.

### How Property Tokenization Works

1. **Asset Representation**: A property, like an SFR, is divided into multiple digital tokens, each representing a fractional share of ownership in the property. The total number of tokens issued corresponds to the propertyâ€™s total value, with each token typically representing an equal fraction.

2. **Blockchain Technology**: The tokens are created and managed on a blockchain, which provides a secure and transparent ledger. This technology ensures that all transactions, including the buying, selling, and trading of tokens, are recorded immutably and are accessible to all participants.

3. **Fractional Ownership**: Investors can purchase any number of tokens, allowing them to own a fraction of a property rather than needing to buy the entire asset. This lowers the barrier to entry for real estate investment, enabling more people to participate in the market with smaller amounts of capital.

4. **Liquidity**: Tokenized properties can be traded on secondary markets, giving investors the ability to buy or sell their fractional ownership at any time. This flexibility contrasts with traditional real estate investments, which are typically illiquid and require lengthy processes to buy or sell.

5. **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts automate many aspects of property management and transactions. These self-executing contracts handle everything from distributing rental income to token holders to managing the sale of tokens, reducing the need for intermediaries and cutting transaction costs.

6. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: Tokenization must comply with existing real estate and securities regulations. The tokens represent a security interest in the property, and the platform facilitating the tokenization must ensure that all legal requirements are met, including investor accreditation, if necessary.
