A **blockchain** is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the data is secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. Each transaction is grouped into a "block," and these blocks are cryptographically linked to form a "chain." This structure prevents any alteration of previously confirmed transactions and ensures the integrity of the entire ledger.

>**TL;DR:** A blockchain is a decentralized and secure digital ledger that records transactions in a tamper-proof chain of blocks.

### Key Characteristics of Blockchain

1. **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional databases controlled by a central entity, a blockchain is maintained by a network of computers (nodes) that collectively validate and record transactions. This decentralization reduces the risk of data manipulation or single points of failure.

2. **Transparency and Immutability**: Once a transaction is recorded on a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to alter. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a secure link that preserves the history of all transactions. This makes blockchain transparent and highly resistant to tampering.

3. **Consensus Mechanisms**: Blockchain networks use consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), to agree on the validity of transactions. These mechanisms ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain, maintaining its integrity.

4. **Smart Contracts**: Blockchain can host self-executing contracts known as smart contracts. These contracts automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met, enabling automated, trustless transactions.

5. **Cryptographic Security**: Transactions on a blockchain are secured using cryptographic techniques, ensuring that only authorized participants can initiate or validate transactions. This makes blockchain a secure way to manage and transfer digital assets.

### Relevance to CornerBlock
