### What are Fractional Cash Offers?

**Fractional cash offers** allow multiple investors to pool their funds to make a collective cash offer on a property. Instead of one buyer needing the entire amount to purchase a property, several investors contribute smaller amounts, collectively reaching the required capital to make a competitive cash offer. Each investor owns a fractional share of the property proportional to their contribution.

>**TL;DR:** Fractional cash offers allow multiple investors to pool funds and make collective cash offers on properties, reducing capital requirements and increasing bidding power. Investors receive fractional ownership and can benefit from rental income, diversification, and liquidity through secondary markets, making real estate investment more accessible and flexible on platforms like CornerBlock.

### How Fractional Cash Offers Work

1. **Pooling Capital**: Investors interested in a particular property pool their funds into a collective pot, typically held in a secure account managed by a smart contract. Each investor's contribution determines their fractional ownership in the property.

2. **Cash Offer**: Once the required capital is raised, the pooled funds are used to make a cash offer on the property. Cash offers are often more attractive to sellers because they eliminate financing contingencies, making the purchase process faster and more certain.

3. **Fractional Ownership**: If the offer is accepted, the investors receive tokens representing their fractional ownership in the property. These tokens can be held for rental income or traded on a secondary market, providing flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Management and Decision-Making**: After the property is acquired, investors can participate in decision-making processes, such as selecting property managers or approving renovations, through a decentralized governance model. Each investor's voting power is proportional to their ownership stake.

5. **Income Distribution**: Rental income generated from the property is distributed among investors based on their fractional ownership. This income is typically handled automatically through smart contracts, ensuring timely and accurate payments.

6. **Liquidity through Secondary Markets**: Investors can sell their fractional shares on a secondary market if they need to access their capital, providing liquidity that traditional real estate investments lack.
