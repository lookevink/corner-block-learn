**Smart contracts** are self-executing agreements with the terms of the contract directly written into code. These contracts automatically execute and enforce the terms and actions based on predefined conditions, all without the need for intermediaries. Once the conditions are met, the smart contract carries out the associated actions, such as transferring funds, updating records, or executing transactions, ensuring transparency, efficiency, and trust in a decentralized environment.

>**TL;DR:** Smart contracts in CornerBlock automate and secure key processes in SFR investment, including property tokenization, bidding, ownership transfer, rental income distribution, and governance. They enable fractional ownership, transparent transactions, automated portfolio management, and a secondary market for liquidity, making real estate investment more accessible and efficient for middle-income earners.

### Relevance of Smart Contracts to CornerBlock

In the context of CornerBlock, smart contracts are crucial for implementing the platformâ€™s mission to democratize single-family rental (SFR) investments. Here's how they play a vital role:

1. **Property Tokenization**: Smart contracts facilitate the tokenization process by automatically generating and distributing fractional ownership tokens to investors. These tokens represent ownership stakes in specific SFR properties, allowing middle-income investors to participate with lower capital requirements.

2. **Secure and Transparent Bidding**: When investors pool funds to bid on properties, smart contracts hold the funds in a virtual escrow. They ensure that the funds are only released when specific conditions are met, such as reaching the required capital or having a successful offer accepted. This ensures security and transparency in the transaction process.

3. **Automated Portfolio Management**: Smart contracts enable automated distribution of investments across multiple properties, tailored to individual investor preferences. For example, if an investor prefers a diversified portfolio, the smart contract can allocate funds across different properties based on risk and return profiles without manual intervention.

4. **Streamlined Transactions**: Once a property is acquired, smart contracts automatically handle the transfer of ownership, recording it on the blockchain, and distributing the corresponding tokens to investors. This reduces the need for traditional intermediaries, lowering costs and speeding up the process.

5. **Efficient Rental Income Distribution**: Rental income from the properties is distributed to token holders automatically through smart contracts, based on their proportional ownership. This ensures timely and accurate payments without the need for manual calculations or third-party involvement.

6. **Governance and Decision-Making**: Smart contracts facilitate decentralized governance by enabling token holders to vote on important decisions, such as property management, major renovations, or property sales. The voting process is transparent, secure, and tamper-proof, ensuring that the collective will of the investors is executed.

7. **Liquidity via Secondary Market**: Smart contracts enable the creation of a secondary market where investors can buy and sell their tokens. This provides liquidity, allowing investors to access funds more easily by selling their ownership stakes without needing to go through the lengthy process of selling the entire property.
