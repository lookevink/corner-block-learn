## Problem
[[Single family rental]], despite its risk-adjusted & stable return profile, is often unattractive to majority of middle income earners for the following reasons:

1. **High Initial Capital Requirement:** Middle-class households may need to allocate significant savings for down payments, which can limit liquidity and the potential for long-term asset growth.
2. **Lack of Liquidity:** Investing in SFR properties ties up a substantial amount of capital, making it difficult for middle-class investors to access funds quickly if needed for other financial obligations.
3. **Competition from Institutions** Middle-class investors may face stiff competition from institutional buyers in hot markets, which see strong cash offers made possible through economies of scale.
4. **Demanding Property Management:** For working professionals, managing a rental property alongside a full-time job can be overwhelming, leading to potential mistakes or neglect that can hurt rental income and property value.
5. **Long Transaction Cycles:** Close of escrow, renovation, tenant placement, and other steps of real estate transactions are time-consuming, delaying income generation and tying up capital for extended periods.

## Solution
CornerBlock plans to democratize SFR investment with:

1. **Property Tokenization:** Tokenization enables fractional ownership, reducing upfront capital requirements to generating SFR income.
2. **Secondary Market:** On-chain secondary market for tokenized assets enables fractional SFR investors to access liquidity through peer-to-peer transactions, allowing for cheaper and greater flexibility.
3. **Fractional Cash Offers:** Pooling funds enables multiple investors to make competitive & all cash bids on properties, as investors can unlock greater capital efficiency by adjusting the risks and amount of upfront investment.
4. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations:** Fractional owners can vote to choose property management professionals, or rely on the management of other fractional owners, at agreed upon fees. Investors can choose to be as involved or passive in the process.
5. **Instant Settlement:** Smart contracts allow for instant settlement and other programmable automations to vastly reduce both cost and duration of a transaction.
